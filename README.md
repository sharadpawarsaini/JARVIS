# **JARVIS - AI Voice Assistant**  

## **Project Overview**  
JARVIS (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is an AI-powered voice assistant designed to assist users with various tasks, including playing music, fetching news and weather updates, performing Google searches, retrieving Wikipedia summaries, and controlling applications through voice commands. The assistant features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter and integrates APIs for web scraping, natural language processing, and automation.

## **Key Features**  

### üîä **Voice Recognition & Text-to-Speech (TTS)**  
- Uses **SpeechRecognition** for real-time speech processing.  
- Converts recognized speech into text commands.  
- Utilizes **pyttsx3** for voice responses, set to a female voice for better clarity.  

### üåê **Web Browsing & Wikipedia Integration**  
- Performs Google searches based on user queries.  
- Uses **Wikipedia API** to fetch and summarize relevant information.  
- Opens frequently used websites such as Google, YouTube, Facebook, and LinkedIn.  

### üé∂ **Spotify Music Control**  
- Integrates **Spotify API** to search and play songs.  
- Allows users to play music with simple voice commands.  

### üì∞ **News & Weather Updates**  
- Fetches top news headlines from **NewsAPI** and reads them aloud.  
- Retrieves real-time weather information based on location using **Weather API**.  

### üñ•Ô∏è **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**  
- Built with **Tkinter** for an interactive user experience.  
- Displays a dynamic sound wave animation when speaking.  
- Provides a "Speak" button for manual activation.  

### üé§ **Real-time Voice Command Processing**  
- Listens continuously for commands.  
- Handles various voice-based requests like "Play a song," "Tell me the news," "What is the weather?"  
- Responds interactively to user questions.  

### üõ† **Technologies Used**  
- **Python** (Core Language)  
- **SpeechRecognition** (Voice input processing)  
- **Pyttsx3** (Text-to-Speech engine)  
- **Wikipedia API** (Fetching knowledge)  
- **Spotipy** (Spotify API for music control)  
- **Tkinter** (GUI framework)  
- **Requests & BeautifulSoup** (Web scraping for news and weather)

## **Future Enhancements**  
- **AI-based Query Handling**: Using NLP models for better command interpretation.  
- **Advanced Web Scraping**: Expanding information retrieval capabilities.  
- **Personalized Responses**: Learning from user behavior for improved interaction.  
- **Task Automation**: Integrating with smart home devices and automation services.  

This project serves as a foundation for an intelligent personal assistant that can evolve into a more advanced AI system with additional features like face recognition, deep learning-based NLP, and enhanced contextual understanding. üöÄ
